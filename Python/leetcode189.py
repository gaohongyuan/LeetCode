# Rotate Array

# best idea that I don't know: rotate the whole array, then rotate the part before k and the part after k

# Rotate an array of n elements to the right by k steps.
#
# For example, with n = 7 and k = 3, the array [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] is rotated to [5,6,7,1,2,3,4].
#
# Note:
# Try to come up as many solutions as you can, there are at least 3 different ways to solve this problem.
#
# [show hint]
#
# Hint:
# Could you do it in-place with O(1) extra space?

# in-place and O(1) extra space
