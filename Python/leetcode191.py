# Number of 1 Bits

# tricky: n &= n - 1: remove the rightmost 1 bit of n

# Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of ’1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).
#
# For example, the 32-bit integer ’11' has binary representation 00000000000000000000000000001011, so the function should return 3.
